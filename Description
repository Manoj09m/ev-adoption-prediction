This project aims to predict regional electric vehicle (EV) adoption rates by integrating geospatial, economic, and vehicle-specific data. Using datasets from government transportation statistics, open geospatial portals, and market reports, the model identifies patterns and key drivers influencing EV uptake across different regions. The analysis applies machine learning techniques (including regression, ensemble methods, and geospatial modeling) to produce accurate forecasts. These insights can assist policymakers in infrastructure planning, automotive companies in market targeting, and sustainability advocates in promoting cleaner transportation solutions.
